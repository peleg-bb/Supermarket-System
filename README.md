A supermarket management system.
This system was developed as a project for our 2nd-year course in software engineering at Ben Gurion University.
The system consists of 4 modules - Deliveries, HR Management, Suppliers and Inventory, with each couple of students responsible for a pair.
The system supports a GUI as well as a CLI, and this version of the code has access to the interfaces of the Deliveries and HR modules.
